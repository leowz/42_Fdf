### What is FDF?

As is said before, fdf is a graphic application. By using a fdf file, it can recreate the
landscape recorded in the fdf file. It is sort of an data visualization app.
If we have enough fdf maps for the app, it is super fun and interesting.
I also added mouse control for the map to make it feels like a game.
See example.

The Fdf format is simply a matrix used to represent an landscape. The height and 
width of this matrix is the longth and width of the landscape. And each value of
the matrix represents the altitude of each point in the landscape.


### Example usage

Here are some examples to demonstrate the basic functionalities of this application.

The first map shows a 42 icon.

This shows that this app can be quit useful and interesting with correct maps.
